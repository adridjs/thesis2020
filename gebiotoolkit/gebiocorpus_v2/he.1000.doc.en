<seg id="6">On 31 January 2012, José Ignacio Wert announced that the subject Education for Citizenship, which was severely criticized by the Catholic Church and by the Partido Popular itself, would be replaced by another subject, called Civil and Constitutional education that, according to the minister, would be "free of controversial issues" and won't be "capable of any ideological recruitment".<\seg>

<seg id="11">That version was complemented by those of other girls, who indicated that Chamba regularly asked for their phone numbers with the excuse that if something bad happened with their cars he would call them immediately.<\seg>

<seg id="1">That is why I organized this action.<\seg>
<seg id="2">Rather, I felt I had to make a gesture that would accurately reflect my situation."<\seg>
<seg id="3">The doors of the building were partially burnt.<\seg>
<seg id="4">He was charged with vandalism due to the tire burning.<\seg>
<seg id="5">All this has been done in order to turn people into gutless and securely guarded cattle, which can only consume, work, and reproduce.<\seg>
<seg id="6">A few hours after the action, a video appeared on the Internet with an explanation of the meaning of the burning.<\seg>
<seg id="7">The human body is naked like a carcass, there is nothing on it except the barbed wire, which by the way was invented for the protection of livestock.<\seg>
<seg id="8">He was awarded the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent in 2016.<\seg>
<seg id="9">The artist remained silent, lying still in a half-bent position inside the cocoon, and did not react to the actions of others until he was released by the police with the help of garden clippers.<\seg>
<seg id="10">A series of laws aimed at suppressing civic activism, intimidation of the population, steadily growing number of political prisoners, the laws against NGOs, the 18+ laws, censorship laws, activity of Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, "promotion of homosexuality" laws – all these laws aren't aimed against criminals, but against the people.<\seg>
<seg id="11">These laws like the wire, keep people in individual pens: all this persecution of political activists, "prisoners of May, 6", governmental repressions is the metaphor of the pen with the barbed wire around it.<\seg>
<seg id="12">On May 3, 2013, Pavlensky held a political protest against repressive government policies.<\seg>
<seg id="13">And against the backdrop of hellfire is a lonely artist, waiting to be captured ... Pavlensky's figure at the door of the FSB in flames - very important symbol for today's Russia, both political and artistic."<\seg>
<seg id="14">In 2013, in front of the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, he organized a street art exhibition titled "Ghosts of Identity", which came as a project of his "Political Propaganda" periodical.<\seg>
<seg id="15">During his fourth year in the Academy, he took additional training at St. Petersburg Pro Arte Foundation for Culture and Arts.<\seg>
<seg id="16">The criminal case against Pavlensky was opened on November 9, 2015 under the "vandalism" section of Article 214 of the Russian criminal code.<\seg>
<seg id="17">"A naked artist, looking at his testicles nailed to the cobblestone is a metaphor of apathy, political indifference, and fatalism of Russian society," declared Pavlensky in his statement to the media.<\seg>
<seg id="18">On November 10, 2015 in the Tagansky district court, in support of Oleg Sentsov, Pavlensky declared: "I want my action to be reclassified to terrorism."<\seg>
<seg id="19">On February 23, 2014, Pavlensky organized an action called "Freedom" in support of Maidan and the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.<\seg>
<seg id="20">In her interview with Radio Liberty, Pavlensky's colleague Oksana Shalygina mentioned that a metaphor of the action had its immediate realization in the reality: as soon as the barbed wire was cut off, and the artist was freed from it, the same exact wire wrapped him back in with police, ambulances and numerous field investigators.<\seg>
<seg id="21">Pavlensky came to the first entrance of the Lubyanka Building, which is the headquarters of the Russian Federal Security Service, on November 9, 2015 at 1:15 a.m. Moscow time, doused the front door with gasoline, and set fire to it with a cigarette lighter.<\seg>
<seg id="22">On July 23, 2012, Pavlensky appeared at Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg with his lips sewn shut, holding a banner that stated, "Action of Pussy Riot was a replica of the famous action of Jesus Christ (Matthew 21:12–13)".<\seg>
<seg id="23">Born in Leningrad in 1984, Pavlensky studied monumental art at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy.<\seg>
<seg id="24">On November 10, 2013, while sitting naked on the stone pavement in front of Lenin's Mausoleum on the Red Square, Moscow, Pavlensky hammered a large nail through his scrotum, affixing it to the stone pavement.<\seg>

<doc docid="Claudi Arimany" wpid="43897572" language="en" topic="C2" gender="Male">
<title> Claudi Arimany</title>
<seg id="1">In 1982 he obtained his diploma in Paris, with a first prize awarded unanimously by the jury.<\seg>
<seg id="2">Arimany, who had studied with him, began to work with him in the late 1980s.<\seg>
<seg id="3">The last album they recorded together was dedicated to Mozart and Hoffmeister and released in 1999.<\seg>
<seg id="4">He has been a member of the jury at the International JP Rampal Flute Competition, held in Paris.<\seg>
<seg id="5">Shortly before, Rampal had written his opinion on the art of his pupil and tour companion, which can be considered his artistic will.<\seg>
<seg id="6">Since the 1980s he has performed with leading international orchestras as a guest soloist, as well as teaching and working to study and revive pieces for flute.<\seg>
<seg id="7">The continuous recovery of works by this author allowed for concerts to be performed in many venues, including the Théâtre des Champs Elysées in Paris, together with the Paris Orchestral Ensemble in November 1994.<\seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to his renowned career as a great flautist, Jean-Pierre Rampal embarked on a paedagogical quest to recover and spread the flute repertoire, becoming the teacher of an entire generation.<\seg>
<seg id="9">Arimany has recorded four CDs with the fourteen concertos for flute and orchestra by Devienne, a type of music which Arimany considers "natural, clear, elegant and melancholic, and requires great technical skill".<\seg>
<seg id="10">The challenging recovery project culminated in the 1986 release of the album "Virtuose Flötenmusik - Schüler der Bach" by the German Motette record label (Wiesbaden).<\seg>
<seg id="11">Gratacós also invited two masters of that time, Alain Marion and Jean-Pierre Rampal, to participate in the classes when they visited Barcelona to perform.<\seg>
<seg id="12">Arimany's response to this rejection was to team up with soloists Alexander Schmoller (cello) and Michael Gruber (harpsichord) to review and select virtually unknown pieces practically by German disciples of the Thuringian master.<\seg>
<seg id="13">The trail of little-known authors took him to the work of François Devienne, a composer and performer who had been popular in his time, earning the moniker "the French Mozart", and had founded the Conservatoire de Paris.<\seg>
<seg id="14">He lives close to his native region, in Llerona (Les Franqueses del Vallès), whose municipal music school is named after him, and teaches at the "Josep Maria Ruera" Granollers Music School.<\seg>
<seg id="15">His special interest in finding Catalan composers who had written for the flute led him to highlight the work of Joan Baptista Pla (Balaguer, 1720-1762), a contemporary of Mozart who travelled throughout Europe, few works of whom have survived.<\seg>
<seg id="16">He later recorded two CDs, one with Jean-Pierre Rampal and the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra with works by Joan Plan, and another with three concerts with the English Chamber Orchestra.<\seg>
<seg id="17">He took lessons from pianist and composer Josep Maria Ruera in Arimany's home city and from Salvador Gratacós in Barcelona.<\seg>
<seg id="18">This was how Arimany met master Rampal, but it was not until Arimany saw him act at the Palau de la Música Catalana that he decided to change tack and continue his musical studies in Nice and Paris with masters such as Georgy Sebok, Alain Marion and Raymond Guiot.<\seg>
<seg id="19">He has also travelled around the world and been invited by leading international groups, such as the Berlin Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, China National Symphony Orchestra, Bach Orchestra Stuttgart, Moscow Chamber Orchestra, Stuttgarter Kammerorchester, European Union Chamber Orchestra, I Virtuosi Italiani, Czech Philharmonic Mendelssohn Chamber Orchestra Philharmonia Virtuosi New York, New American Chamber Orchestra, Orchestra Internazionale d'Italia, Virtuosi di Praga Chamber Orchestra, Franz Liszt Orchestra Budapest, Arthur Rubinstein Chamber Orchestra Polonia, Israel Sinfonietta, Ensemble Orchestral of Paris, Zagreb Soloists, English Chamber Orchestra Amadeus Chamber Orchestra and Berliner Kammerorchester.<\seg>

# Word2Vec
This module is used to train a word2vec model that generates word vectors in an embedded space,
 based on context-similar words.

## DataDriver
To parse and filter the sentences generated by `align.py`, execute the following command:
```
python3 data_driver.py -l es en -f ../gebiotoolkit/corpus_alignment/aligned/ -s /biographies
```
You can either specify the languages via command line with the `-l` argument, or let the script pull the desired
 languages from the `LANGUAGES` set defined  in `word2vec/utils/constants.py` 

## Trainer
Now that we have filtered our sentences and generated the xmls/txt, we can train our word vectors model. 
```
python3 trainer.py --language en --input_folder biographies --min_count 5 
```

# Word2Vec
This module is used to train a word2vec model that generates word vectors in an embedded space,
 based on context-similar words.

## DataDriver
To parse and filter the sentences generated by `align.py`, execute the following command:
```
word2vec/data_driver.py -l es en -f ../gebiotoolkit/corpus_alignment/aligned/
```
You can either specify the languages via command line with the `-l` argument, or let the script pull the desired
 languages from the `LANGUAGES` set defined  in `word2vec/utils/constants.py` 

## Data
We could get gendered pairs in Spanish from Ayuntamiento de Málaga. That list of pairs can increase throughout time, 
and don't hesitate doing it.

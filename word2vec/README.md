# Word2Vec
This module is used to train a word2vec model that generates word vectors in an embedded space,
 based on context-similar words.

## DataDriver
To parse and filter the sentences generated by `align.py`, execute the following command:
```
word2vec/data_driver.py -l es en -f ../gebiotoolkit/corpus_alignment/aligned/
```
You can either specify the languages via command line with the `-l` argument, or let the script pull the desired
 languages from the `LANGUAGES` set defined  in `word2vec/utils/constants.py` 

## Trainer
Now that we have filtered our sentences and generated the xmls, we can train our word vectors model. The balanced
 dataset is generated at runtime, you could also save one sample generated in an earlier execution to have a unique 
  trainset.
```
python3 trainer.py --language en --input_folder biographies --min_count 5 
```

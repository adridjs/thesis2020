# Word2Vec
This module is used to train a word2vec model that generates word vectors in an embedded space,
 based on context-similar words.

## DataDriver
To parse and filter the sentences generated by `align.py`, execute the following command:
```
word2vec/data_driver.py -l es en -f ../gebiotoolkit/corpus_alignment/aligned/
```
You can either specify the languages via command line with the `-l` argument, or let the script pull the desired
 languages from `LANGUAGES`  in `word2vec/utils/constants.py`
